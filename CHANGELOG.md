# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Corrected the MiniMax H3 reference-to-video 768p rate from 16 to 8 credits per second to match the live Kie.ai price list (rate card version 2026-09-30).

### Added
- Added the `get_balance` tool and `KieAiClient.getCredits()` (`GET /chat/credit`).
- Added a spend guard shared by `submit_media_generation` and direct image, video, and audio calls (MCP and CLI): balance check before spending, optional `KIE_AI_MAX_CREDITS_PER_PLAN` and `KIE_AI_DAILY_CREDIT_CAP` caps, `KIE_AI_ALLOW_UNPRICED`, and `KIE_AI_SKIP_BALANCE_CHECK`.
- Added a local `spend_log` table backing the rolling 24h cap.
- Added verified rate-card formulas for Nano Banana 2 (1K/2K/4K), GPT Image 2 (1K/2K/4K, text and image-to-image), and Veo 3.1 Fast/Quality at 720p, so far more plans get an exact price and can be checked against the balance and caps.
- Added the opt-in `npm run pricing:drift` script that compares the rate card with Kie.ai's live price list.
- Prepared plans now carry a display-only budget snapshot (balance, credits left, approximate USD, caps) that is shown in the approval message.

## MCP 5.1.0 / CLI 0.9.0 / OpenAI transport 0.7.0 - 2026-08-25

### Added
- Added Wan 3.0 multimodal inputs for image, video, audio, document, and webpage references.
- Added first-frame and first-and-last-frame generation, native audio control, smart duration, and clips up to 30 seconds.
- Added the `kie-wan-3-0-video` OpenAI model ID while retaining `kie-wan-2-7-video` as a compatibility alias.

### Changed
- Upgraded `wan_video` from the four Wan 2.7 endpoints to the unified `wan/3-0-video` endpoint.
- Expanded Wan reference limits to 10 images, 5 videos, and 5 audio clips based on the official Kie.ai contract.
- Replaced Wan 2.7-only prompt, negative prompt, watermark, and edit-mode parameters with the Wan 3.0 schema.

## OpenAI transport 0.6.1 - 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- Mapped pixel dimensions within a 3% logarithmic tolerance to the nearest aspect ratio supported by the selected image adapter.
- Preserved strict validation for explicit ratio strings and dimensions outside the bounded tolerance.
- Normalized equivalent exact and rounded sizes before idempotency fingerprinting for both generation and edit routes.

## OpenAI transport 0.6.0 - 2026-08-25

### Added
- Added `kie-midjourney-video` for one-image Midjourney image-to-video generation.
- Added `kie-grok-video` for Grok Imagine text-to-video and one-image image-to-video generation.
- Added explicit operation exclusions for unsupported mixed-tool image, reference, and upscale modes.
- Added Midjourney `successFlag` and `resultInfoJson.resultUrls` status normalization.

### Changed
- Expanded registry-derived discovery and dispatch with both Phase 4 video adapters.
- Added adapter-owned reference limits and malformed-result, host-isolation, cardinality, and early-rejection coverage.
- Preserved contract version 3 and the existing four public model IDs.

## OpenAI transport 0.5.0 - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Added registry-driven video adapters for Kling 3.0, MiniMax H3, Veo 3, Wan 2.7, and HappyHorse 1.0.
- Added exact create, reference upload, polling, content download, idempotency, and early-rejection coverage for every new video model.

### Changed
- Expanded `/v1/models` from the resolved registry with five additional video IDs.
- Kept Wan and HappyHorse video editing, and other specialized inputs, out of the standard create-video contract.
- Added the named Veo status strategy while keeping provider polling behind `KieAiClient`.

## OpenAI transport 0.4.0 - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Added registry-driven generation and editing adapters for Seedream 5 Pro, Qwen Image, Flux 2 Pro, and Flux Kontext Pro.
- Added exact Infinite Canvas generation and multipart edit contracts for every new public model.

### Changed
- Expanded `/v1/models` with four stable `-image` IDs while preserving per-model formats, quality limits, references, task cardinality, status parsing, and result-host isolation.
- Removed the four completed image tools from the explicit OpenAI exclusion map.

## OpenAI transport 0.3.0 - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Replaced the OpenAI transport model list with a resolved adapter registry joined to the core catalog and tool registry.
- Added `kie-z-image` generation through the standard images route.

### Changed
- Discovery, model validation, result-host policy, and dispatch now share the resolved registry. Active media tools are explicitly adapted or excluded with a reason.
- Z-Image accepts Infinite Canvas's standard `n`, `quality=standard`, and `output_format=png` request shape, and Seedance aliases are idempotent across equivalent model IDs.
- Incremented the OpenAI transport contract version to 3.

## OpenAI transport 0.2.0 - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Added authenticated `GET /v1/models` discovery for the four public image and
  video model IDs, backed by one transport-owned model catalog.
- Added Infinite Canvas request compatibility: model-aware image
  `output_format` handling and Seedance `preset=normal` normalization.

### Changed
- Nano Banana accepts PNG, JPG, and the equivalent JPEG alias. GPT Image 2 keeps
  its fixed PNG contract because Kie exposes no provider output-format setting.
- Explicit image formats are verified against the downloaded MIME type and file
  signature. Unsupported formats, presets, masks, and transparent backgrounds
  fail before uploads, journal reservation, or provider submission.
- Incremented the OpenAI transport contract version to 2.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
- Migrated the MCP server to the split SDK v2 packages (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`,
  `@modelcontextprotocol/node`, `@modelcontextprotocol/client` in tests) on the
  2026-07-28 specification line. The server negotiates the protocol version per
  client and continues serving 2025-era clients (dual era). Node >= 20 required.
- Upgraded the workspace to zod v4. Tool `inputSchema` is now derived with
  zod4's native `toJSONSchema` (JSON Schema 2020-12, the dialect MCP 2026-07-28
  targets) while keeping defaulted fields optional and unknown parameters
  tolerated.
- Adopted Biome for formatting, import organization, and linting across the
  monorepo. The `check` script (Biome) runs in the Verify workflow; type
  checking remains authoritative via `tsc --noEmit`.
- MCP state is now owned by a transport-independent caller principal instead of
  an individual Server instance: the approval owner, generation plans, widget
  grants, and staged uploads stay addressable across fresh Server instances of
  the same session.
- Structured results: failed tool calls return `isError: true` with structured
  error content, and task-bearing successes expose `structuredContent`
  (`task_id`, `status`, `api_type`) through a central normalization seam.
- Plan approval now works on 2026-07-28 hosts through the multi-round-trip
  (MRTR) seam: prepared plans without a decision become input_required
  results carrying the approval form, and the host answers on the retried
  call. Legacy 2025-era hosts keep the push-style elicitation flow.
- Protocol-modern discovery: the server answers `server/discover` with the
  supported versions, capabilities and instructions, declares the MCP Apps
  extension used by the upload widget, and advertises cache hints for the
  stable `tools/list` and `server/discover` results. Tools with guaranteed
  structured content (preparation, upload capabilities, and generation task
  results) now advertise `outputSchema`.
- Official MCP Tasks (experimental, opt-in via `KIE_AI_MCP_TASKS=true`): a
  durable in-process task engine backed by the local SQLite database, the
  `tasks` capability, per-tool `execution.taskSupport`, and the task-mode
  `tools/call` surface with `tasks/result`/`tasks/list`/`tasks/cancel`. The
  published MCP SDK still negotiates at most 2025-11-25, so task-mode calls
  are refused with a clear error until the SDK lifts negotiation to
  2026-07-28; the legacy task-status tools remain available in all modes.
- Fixed the MCP `start`/`dev` scripts' `.env` path: the env file lives at the repository root, so the scripts now load `../../.env` from the package directory; the Inspector instructions in `AGENTS.md` run from the repo root.
- MCP Apps negotiation: the upload widget resource (`ui://kie/upload.html`) is
  exposed only to hosts that declare the Apps extension; other clients keep the
  widget tool's plain-text fallback.
- Structured results extended to the media pipeline: `finalize_upload` and
  `submit_media_generation` return `structuredContent` and advertise
  `outputSchema`.


### CLI (0.8.0)
- CLI help and command derivation follow the shared zod4 JSON Schema generator
  (`toInputJsonSchema`, JSON Schema 2020-12) with no user-facing command
  changes. Ships alongside MCP 5.0.0.

### Security
- Streamable HTTP uploads are now scoped per session owner; one session can no
  longer finalize media staged by a different session (they previously shared a
  single bearer owner).

## [4.3.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added
- Added `upload_file` to MCP 4.3.0 and CLI 0.7.0. Base64 media is bounded and
  signature-validated before Kie receives it. CLI local paths require an
  explicit `KIE_CLI_UPLOAD_ROOTS` boundary. Arbitrary URL import is not exposed.
- Added optional temporary HTTP storage through `get_upload_url`. Authenticated
  MCP calls mint high-entropy upload and download capabilities. Uploads stream
  to private temporary files with exact byte, MIME, signature, quota and TTL
  checks. Only an opaque `media_id` enters app/model content; the server creates
  a bounded read capability immediately before Kie fetches it.
- Added the `upload_widget` MCP Apps resource at `ui://kie/upload.html`, using
  the stable `text/html;profile=mcp-app` contract, a session grant for app-only helpers,
  restrictive resource CSP and a plain-text fallback for non-Apps clients.

### Security
- Temporary browser uploads require explicit `KIE_MCP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, MCP
  bearer auth, Host and Origin allowlists, and a separate upload Origin
  allowlist. No widget or capability response contains the Kie or MCP bearer.
- Replaced the unsafe PR #10 architecture instead of exposing unauthenticated
  upload management routes or unrestricted server-side URL fetching.
- MCP bearer and Origin checks now run before the JSON parser, so unauthorized
  bodies are rejected without buffering or parsing.

### Changed
- Remote HTTP deployments can configure `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; it is mandatory
  together with `MCP_UPLOAD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` when temporary storage is enabled.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
- `grok_imagine` now sends text-to-image requests to Grok Imagine Image 2.0
  (`grok-imagine-image-2-0/text-to-image`) instead of the retired legacy image
  endpoint. The tool supplies `1:1` when `aspect_ratio` is omitted.
- Added explicit `image-to-image` routing through Grok Imagine Image 2.0 image
  edit (`grok-imagine-image-2-0/image-edit`). It requires `prompt` and one to
  five `image_urls`; image URLs without this explicit mode continue to mean
  image-to-video for backward compatibility.
- Image pricing remains `unknown` because no source-backed exact rate-card
  formula is available.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added
- `bytedance_seedance_video` accepts the optional `extension_task_id` input in
  both `@felores/kie-ai-mcp-server` 4.1.0 and `@felores/kie-cli` 0.5.0. Kie.ai
  receives the value inside the Seedance 2.5 `input` object as experimental
  semantic continuation context.
- Documentation distinguishes semantic task continuation from visual
  continuity. Use `first_frame_url` when the next video must begin from an
  extracted final frame.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- The installed `kie-ai-mcp-server` npm bin now starts correctly through its
  `.bin` symlink instead of exiting before connecting to the configured transport.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-17

### Breaking Changes
- The MCP server no longer lists or accepts direct generation tools by default.
  Use `prepare_media_generation` followed by `submit_media_generation` so a
  persisted plan is reviewed before provider tasks are created. Set
  `KIE_AI_ALLOW_DIRECT_GENERATION=true` only for the explicit compatibility path.

### Added
- **Planned media generation workflow**: prepare one to six validated requests,
  review the resolved settings and known prices, record approval, then submit the
  approved plan. MCP hosts approve through elicitation; `@felores/kie-cli` 0.4.0
  requires an explicit matching `--approve <plan-id>` value.
- **Pricing audit and refresh controls**: source-backed formula coverage can be
  audited, and refresh accepts only reviewed exact-credit proposals with valid
  calendar verification dates. Refresh remains read-only unless `--apply` is
  supplied.

### Fixed
- Remote HTTP transport now refuses non-loopback bindings unless both
  `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `KIE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` are configured.
- Clients advertising legacy `{ elicitation: {} }` capabilities are treated as
  form-capable, while clients without elicitation keep plans unapproved.

## [3.6.1] - 2026-08-16

### Changed
- `hailuo_video` now uses MiniMax H3 (Hailuo 03). The public tool name is
  unchanged, while requests now route to the H3 text-to-video,
  image-to-video, or reference-to-video models.
- The tool accepts camelCase H3 inputs: `imageUrl`/`endImageUrl` for first/last
  frames and `referenceImageUrls`, `referenceVideoUrls`, and
  `referenceAudioUrls` for multimodal reference generation. It validates that
  image and reference modes are mutually exclusive.
- Removed legacy Hailuo 02/2.3 `version`, `quality`, `resolution`, and
  `promptOptimizer` fields. They now fail validation instead of being mapped to
  MiniMax H3 semantics.
- `bytedance_seedance_video` now uses Seedance 2.5. The public
  tool name is unchanged and every request now uses
  `bytedance/seedance-2-5` through `/jobs/createTask`.
- Removed Seedance 2.0 `mode` (`standard`/`fast`/`mini`), `web_search`, and
  `nsfw_checker` inputs. The 2.5 tool accepts text, first/last frames, or
  multimodal image/video/audio references, which are mutually exclusive.
- `return_last_frame` is now an optional boolean and is sent only when supplied.
  Removed undocumented Seedance 2.0 limits and defaults from the public schema.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Six new Kie.ai model capabilities**, available through both the MCP server
  and `kie-cli` (`@felores/kie-cli` 0.3.0): Nano Banana 2 Lite, Seedream 5.0
  Pro, Seedance 2.0 Mini, Suno V5.5, OmniHuman 1.5, and Gemini Omni.
- **`omnihuman_video`** creates talking videos from a portrait image and audio,
  with optional subject masks, 720P/1080P output, fast mode, and reproducible
  seeds.
- **`gemini_omni`** creates multimodal videos and reusable Gemini Omni
  characters or voices. Video requests validate Kie's seven-unit media quota
  before submission.

### Changed
- `nano_banana_image` now supports `nano-banana-2-lite`, constrained to 1K
  output and ten reference images.
- `bytedance_seedream_image` supports Seedream 5.0 Pro text/image generation,
  including 1K/2K quality, PNG/JPEG output, safety filtering, and ten
  references.
- `bytedance_seedance_video` supports the lower-cost `mini` mode and rejects
  invalid combinations of frame and reference inputs.
- `suno_generate_music` supports `V5_5`; requested duration is valid only for
  this model.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Streamable HTTP transport for remote access** (MCP spec 2025-11-25). The
  server still defaults to stdio; opt into HTTP with `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` or the
  `--http` flag. Single `/mcp` endpoint (POST + GET/SSE + DELETE), stateful
  sessions keyed by `Mcp-Session-Id` (each session gets its own MCP `Server`
  over a shared Kie.ai client + task DB).
- **Health endpoint** `GET /health` → `{status, transport, sessions, version}`,
  unauthenticated and exempt from Origin/DNS-rebind checks for container probes.
- **Bearer-token auth** via `KIE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` and **DNS-rebinding protection**
  via `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (required when binding beyond loopback). New env:
  `MCP_HTTP_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`), `MCP_HTTP_PORT` (default `3000`).
- **Deployment**: `packages/mcp/Dockerfile` (multi-stage, bundled, `HEALTHCHECK`),
  root `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.coolify.yml`, and `docs/DEPLOY_HTTP.md`.

This reimplements the capability from closed PR #3 against the current monorepo.
Out of scope for now: OAuth 2.0 (RFC 9728) and `eventStore` stream resumability.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **`wait_for_task` now waits in a single call, no polling.** Pass a `task_id`
  and it blocks until the result is ready (or the timeout) and returns the final
  URLs, so the agent no longer loops over `get_task_status`. By default it polls
  the Kie API directly, so no callback infrastructure is needed; the callback
  "rendezvous" path is kept as an optional fallback for distributed/serverless
  setups (`KIE_AI_RESULT_URL`, the `rendezvous_url` arg, or a
  `KIE_AI_CALLBACK_URL` ending in `/kie/callback`).
- **MCP progress notifications.** While `wait_for_task` waits, the server streams
  `notifications/progress` on the still-open `tools/call` request (when the
  client sends a `progressToken`). Each notification resets the client's request
  timeout, which is how the call stays open past the default 60s. For long jobs,
  clients should enable `resetTimeoutOnProgress` with a generous
  `maxTotalTimeout`. The terminal result reuses `get_task_status`'s per-API
  parsing, so completed Suno/multi-output tasks return every URL.
  (`@felores/kie-cli` → 0.2.0; the CLI gets the single-call wait too, without the
  MCP-only progress stream.)

## [3.3.2] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- Removed em dashes from all docs and from a few tool description strings
  (`bytedance_seedance_video` and its `mode`/`resolution` hints), so the text
  shown in `kie-cli --help` and MCP `listTools` is clean. No functional changes.
- Rewrote the README: fact-checked against the current code, trimmed marketing
  fluff, and led with the token-efficiency story (load only the tools you need
  via `KIE_AI_ENABLED_TOOLS`; the CLI costs zero context tokens until called).
- Added a Spanish README (`README.es.md`) with a language switcher.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- **Task creation now requires `code === 200`.** Six generation tools
  (`kling_video`, `veo3_generate_video`, `nano_banana_image`, `wan_animate`,
  `hailuo_video`, `flux2_image`) persisted a task and returned `success: true`
  whenever the response contained a `taskId`, even when Kie reported an
  application-level failure (HTTP 200 with `code !== 200`). They now only create
  the task and return success when `response.code === 200 && taskId`, otherwise
  they surface the API error message, matching the other 19 tools.
  (Addresses the CodeRabbit review on PR #2; `@felores/kie-cli` → 0.1.1.)

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Standalone CLI** (`@felores/kie-cli`, binary `kie-cli`): every Kie.ai model is
  now usable from the terminal with no MCP client. Commands and flags are
  generated from the same tool registry as the MCP server. Supports `--json` for
  machine-readable output. Installs completely independently of the MCP server.
- **`npm run add-tool <name>`**: scaffolds a new tool file and registers it, so
  adding a model is one file plus a client method. Both the MCP server and the
  CLI pick it up automatically.

### Fixed
- **Resources and prompts now work.** The model-documentation resources (17) and
  the `image`/`video` prompts loaded Markdown from an `ai_docs/` directory that
  did not ship in the package, so `resources/read` and `prompts/get` failed with
  ENOENT for every one of them (pre-existing bug). They are now **generated from
  the tool registry**: each tool exposes a `kie://tools/<name>` resource rendered
  from its schema, and the prompts list the tools for their category. Nothing is
  read from disk, so they can never drift or 404. `resources/read` now succeeds
  for all 33 resources (was 5/22); both prompts return content.

### Changed
- **Monorepo architecture**: the project is now an npm-workspaces monorepo with a
  shared, unpublished `core` package (tool registry, Zod schemas, API client,
  task database) that is bundled into both the MCP server and the CLI at build
  time. One source of truth, two independently installable packages.
- **Tools come from a single registry**: `listTools` and tool dispatch are
  derived from the registry instead of 28 hand-written JSON Schemas and a 6,000+
  line switch. MCP tool names, descriptions and behaviour are unchanged.
- **`inputSchema` is now derived from each tool's Zod schema.** This corrects
  pre-existing drift between the hand-written JSON Schema and the validator. Most
  visible on `midjourney_generate`, whose advertised parameters/enums now match
  what is actually validated (e.g. `speed` accepts `relax`, not `relaxed`).
  Runtime validation behaviour is unchanged.
- **Upgraded `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from `^0.4.0` to `^1.29.0`.** Server
  capabilities (`tools`, `resources`, `prompts`) are now declared explicitly, as
  required by the 1.x SDK. Protocol behaviour is unchanged: `tools/list` (28),
  `resources/list` (22) and `prompts/list` (2) all respond as before.

### Notes
- The MCP package keeps its name `@felores/kie-ai-mcp-server` and bin
  `kie-ai-mcp-server`; existing client configurations require no changes.
- Minimum `zod` is now `^3.24.0` (the bundled `zod-to-json-schema` uses the
  `zod/v3` subpath, which older zod releases do not export).

## [3.2.1] - 2026-05-02

### Removed
- **Sora 2** (`sora_video`): Removed following OpenAI deprecation. All Sora 2 endpoints (text-to-video, image-to-video, storyboard, characters, watermark remover) are no longer available.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Breaking Changes
- **GPT Image 2**: Replaced `openai_4o_image` tool with `gpt_image_2`
